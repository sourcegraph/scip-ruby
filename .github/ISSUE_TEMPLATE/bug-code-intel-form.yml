        The functionality for the feature(s):
        <!--
        - Find references
        - Go to definition
        - Hover documentation
        - Other: <more info here>
        -->
        
        has undesirable behavior:
        <!--
        - Does not have any code intelligence at all
        - Code intelligence is low-quality; could do with improvements
        - Has incorrect information
        - Other: <more info here>
        -->
        
        in the following contexts that I've seen:
        <!--
        - Within a single function
        - Across functions within the same file
        - Across files within the same gem
        - Across different gems
        -->

        (Optional) Temporarily replace the 'scip-ruby' in your gemspec or Gemfile
        with a dependency on the same version of scip-ruby-debug instead
        (by editing your gemspec or Gemfile) and re-run the indexing step.

        If you see a crash (e.g. an assertion being hit), please report it below.
      value: |
        After replacing `scip-ruby` with `scip-ruby-debug` in my Gemfile/gemspec,
        and running `bundle install`, I re-ran `bundle exec scip-ruby <paste args>`
        <!-- and that completed successfully without crashing. -->
        and got this<!-- anonymized --> crash output:
        ```txt
